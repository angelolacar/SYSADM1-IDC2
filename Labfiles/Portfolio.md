 ## üìù Reflection

<b> üìå What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations? </b>

    
      My initial expectations for this subject would be solely on installing Linux and configurations for it. However, 
      the course primarily focused on Windows server and client with VMWare.
  
    
<b> üìå What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did
these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?</b>

    
      The primary topic that was covered most of the time in this course was Windows server & Client configuration. 
      Each topic contributed to my understanding of creating secure, scalable, and efficient IT systems. 
    
    
<b> üìå Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective
strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course
material?</b>

    
      The utilization of VMWare for simulation allowed me to make mistakes for configurations without suffering 
      any consequences, which i find extremely helpful not only for academic purposes but also for future work   
       related. 
    
    
<b> üìå Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that
significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they
effective?</b>

    
    The cybersecurity recovery case study significantly enhanced my learning experience. It was effective because 
    it mirrored real-world challenges, requiring me to apply theoretical knowledge to analyze problems and 
    propose actionable solutions. It provided insight into the practical aspects of incident management.
    
    
<b üìå >Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How
did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?</b>

    
    One big problem i encountered in this subject is the use of VMWare, I have not used VMWare in mmy previous 
    SERADMN subject but instead we used actual PC devices, created cross-cable to connect both pc where we 
    installed windows server and client. I was extremely confused when i cannot connect the server and client 
    because there were no cables and the configurations we did in SERADMN does not apply or work in the VMWare.
    However i manage to overcome these challenges by ignoring what was thought to me in our SERADMN and instead 
    ask questions and ask for help to my seatmates.
    
    
<b> üìå Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it
promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or
decision-making?</b>

    
    Yes, this course helped me utilize and be independent when fixing problems. Going beyond what is 
    being thought in schools and outsourcing.
    
    
<b> üìå Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or
perspectives did you gain from this course?</b>

    
    I gained valuable skills in system configuration, network planning, and incident response. Additionally, 
    my ability to analyze and respond to cybersecurity threats improved.
    
    
<b> üìå How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your
future studies, career, or personal life?</b>

   
    I plan to apply this knowledge to future IT roles by ensuring systems are both robust and scalable. 
    Skills in authentication protocols, capacity planning, and recovery will be crucial for maintaining 
    operational continuity and security. Additionally, this learning will guide my approach to tackling IT 
    challenges, focusing on strategic preparation and efficient problem-solving.
