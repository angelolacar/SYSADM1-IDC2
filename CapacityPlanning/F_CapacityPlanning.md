# SYSADM1 -- Capacity Management & Planning

**Part 2. Network Scalability Analysis**

Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the
expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology
diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability
might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the
network\'s scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user
experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as
increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.

**Network Analysis**

The network design identifies key potential issues that could impact its
efficiency and security. Bottlenecks are most likely to occur at the
access layer, where oversubscription may lead to congestion, or between
the distribution and core layers if link capacities are insufficient
during peak traffic. Security risks include single points of failure,
unauthorized access due to weak access controls, and the absence of
advanced protection mechanisms like intrusion detection systems (IDS).
Furthermore, the capacity of distribution switches could limit the
ability to handle increasing traffic from both end devices and servers
as the network grows. These issues highlight the need for robust traffic
management, redundancy, and security protocols.

**Scalability Planning**

To address scalability, the design proposes three key solutions:
hardware upgrades, software enhancements, and improved traffic
segmentation. Hardware upgrades include adopting stackable distribution
switches with modular capacity, enabling expansion as demand increases.
This approach supports higher-capacity uplinks to reduce congestion and
handle future traffic.
